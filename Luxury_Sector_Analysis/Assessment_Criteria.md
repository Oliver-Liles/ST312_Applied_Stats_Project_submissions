**Summative assessment for ST312 is based on two components:**

- (1) a written project report that is worth 90% of the final mark, 
- (2) an oral presentation that is worth 10  % of the final mark. 

*The project report needs to be no less than 3,000 and no more than 5,000 words. 
The oral presentation will last for approximately 10 minutes. Both the oral presentation and the project are compulsory.*

**The marking is broken down as follows:**

*Report*: 90 marks

- 30 marks: Introduction on the topic, literature review, discussion of the research questions and aims of the project, identify the readership of the project.
- 30 marks: Statistical Analysis and content; descriptive, modelling, algorithms â€“ justification of the methods used, checking of assumptions. 
- 30 marks: Presentation and communication of results; report writing, graphical and other means of data visualization, discussion of limitations and further research.

*Oral Presentation*: 10 marks

- The presentation should describe what you did in your project and what you found out.
  In other words, it is essentially a summary of the main points of your project report.
  Your task will be to communicate this in the time available to the audience in the room, in a way which allows them to understand the key points of your project.
  Your mark for the presentation will be based primarily on how clearly and understandably you communicate this information.
