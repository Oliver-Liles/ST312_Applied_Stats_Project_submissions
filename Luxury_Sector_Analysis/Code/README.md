# ST312 Code


**Modelling:**

*The analysis was done in the following order and using the following programs:*

1) **Contingency Tables**<sup>[[1]](https://github.com/Oliver-Liles/ST312_Applied_Stats_Project_submissions/blob/main/Luxury_Sector_Analysis/Code/ST312_Contingency_Tables.ipynb)</sup> - Python Notebook for intial data manipulation of survey data. This is where we converted the data from the initial format into a series of three contingency tables for each question.

2) **Assumption Checking**<sup>[[2]](https://github.com/Oliver-Liles/ST312_Applied_Stats_Project_submissions/blob/main/Luxury_Sector_Analysis/Code/Checking%20Assumptions.Rmd)</sup> - R code for checking assumptions of Poisson GLMs on the data.

3) **Models**<sup>[[3]](https://github.com/Oliver-Liles/ST312_Applied_Stats_Project_submissions/blob/main/Luxury_Sector_Analysis/Code/ST312_Models%20(22).ipynb)</sup> - Python Notebook for fitting the main models and extracting interactions.
