**Modelling:**

*The analysis was done in the following order and using the following programs:*

1) **Contingency Tables (1/3)** - Python Notebook for intial data manipulation of survey data. This is where we converted the data from the initial format into a series of three contingency tables for each question.

2) **Assumption Checking (2/3)** - R code for checking assumptions of Poisson GLMs on the data.

3) **Models (3/3)** - Python Notebook for fitting the main models and extracting interactions.
